This directory contains various tests:
- functional tests - which test various use-cases
- mechanical tests - which test simple things related to API, like sanity tests and set/get as well

Functional tests
  These tests uses a lot of Cadence verification environment features thus they can't be build properly outside our environment.
  All files are provided as reference code, which shows how to use core driver.

Mechanical tests
  These tests provide sanity tests for driver.
